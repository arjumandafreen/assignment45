// Q:20 Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, 
// rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let mountains: string[] = ['Mount Everest', 'K2', 'Makalu'];


let rivers: string[] = ['Amazon', 'Nile','Yangtze'];


let countries: string[]= ['USA','China','India'];


let cities: string[] = ['New York','Beijing', 'Mumbai'];

console.log(cities);
