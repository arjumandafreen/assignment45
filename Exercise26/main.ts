// Q:26-Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain.
// • If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.

// • If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.

// • Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.


let  alien_Color: string = "green";

if ( alien_Color === "green") {

    console.log("player just earned 5 points");


} else {
console.log("player just earned 10 points") ;

}

 //Running the else block//

alien_Color = "red"

if ( alien_Color === "green") {

console.log("player just earned 5 points");


} else {
    console.log("player just earned 10 points") ;
    
}
